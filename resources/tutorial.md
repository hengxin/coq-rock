- [Mike Nahas's Coq Tutorial; (with `.v` files)](https://coq.inria.fr/tutorial-nahas)

> This tutorial will teach you the basics of using Coq to write formal proofs.
My aim is to teach you a powerful subset of Coq's commands by showing you lots of actual proofs. 

- [A Short Introduction to Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/a-short-introduction-to-coq)

> Properties, programs and proofs are formalized in the same language 
called the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC). 

Two parts:
- The language of Coq
- Proving in Coq
